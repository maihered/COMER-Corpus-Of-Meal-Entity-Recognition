## Curation rationale<br>
<br>
The Corpus Of Meal Entity Recognition is a set of corpora that gathers texts from different culinary websites. As it is a bilingual resource in Spanish and Basque, we have used different webpages for each language. For Spanish, it has six complete recipes from the website Sabor Gourmet. For Basque, we selected five recipes from the websites Guraso and Aiurri. These websites have been selected for their large number of recipes and their licenses CC BY NC 4.0 and CC BY SA 4.0 that allow the generation of derivative works.
<br>
The texts were chosen to have a variety of different recipes, similar sizes and different terms between them. As the aim of this corpus is the annotation of culinary terms, the following steps have been followed: 1) the original texts have been tokenized; 2) the annotators have annotated the culinary terms and searched for their senses in Wordnet.
<br>
## Language variety
<br>
The languages of this corpus are Standard Spanish (ISO 639-1 es) and Standard Basque (ISO 639-1 eu).
<br>
## Speaker demographic
<br>
The original recipes have been written by different authors (between four and ten) and, for most of them, the authors are unknown or there is very little information about them. However, from the dialect, it can be deduced that the authors of the Spanish recipes are fluent in peninsular Spanish and, on the other hand, the authors of the recipes in Basque are native speakers or have a great domain of the standard Basque language.
<br>
## Annotator demographic
<br>
The annotations of this corpus have been carried out in 2023 among five Master's students of Language Analysis and Processing, with a background in linguistics and computer engineering. The age range of the annotators is between 22 and 33 years old, two men and three women from different regions of Spain (Valencia, Basque Country, Madrid and Palencia). All of them are native speakers of Spanish and two of them are native speakers of Basque.
<br>
## Speech situation
<br>
The recipes in Spanish were published between February and March 2023 and the recipes in Basque, between 2019 and 2021. All of them are written texts and have probably been edited. The interaction is asynchronous and aimed at the general public.
<br>
## Text characteristics
<br>
The texts belong to the instructional genre in the culinary field (in the form of recipes).
